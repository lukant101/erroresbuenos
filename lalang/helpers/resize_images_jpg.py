# to resize, once you have the window dimensions, divide each dimension
# of the image by the window dimensions; take the bigger ratio and
# divide both the width and height of the image by this ratio.
# This way either width or height will be maximized,
# and the other dimension will fall below the maximum,
# without changing the imageâ€™s aspect ratio
